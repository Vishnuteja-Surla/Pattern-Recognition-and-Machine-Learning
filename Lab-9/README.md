# Question-1
## Consider the 128- dimensional feature vectors (d=128) given in the “gender.csv” file. (2 classes, male and female)
a) Use LDA to reduce the dimension from d to d‟. (Here d=128)  
b) Choose the direction „W‟ to reduce the dimension d‟ (select appropriate d‟).   
c) Use d‟ features to classify the test cases (use any classification algorithm, Bayes classifier, minimum distance classifier, and so on).


### Dataset Specifications:
Total number of samples = 800   
Number of classes = 2 (labeled as “male” and “female”)  
Samples from “1 to 400” belongs to class “male”   
Samples from “401 to 800” belongs to class “female”   
Number of samples per class = 400   
Number of dimensions = 128   
Use the following information to design classifier:  
Number of test cases (first 10 in each class) = 20   
Number of training feature vectors ( remaining 390 in each class) = 390   
Number of reduced dimensions = d‟ (map 128 to d‟ features vector)

# Question-2
## Fisherfaces- Face classification using LDA (40 classes)
a) Use the following “face.csv” file to classify the faces of 40 different people using LDA.   
b) Do not use the in-built function for implementing LDA.   
c) Use appropriate classifier taught in class (use any classification algorithm taught in class like Bayes classifier, minimum distance classifier, and so on)
